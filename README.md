# Data-Analysis-Monkeypox-SQL-and-Tableau
A data analysis using SQL and Tableau to show the spread of the disease  in the world


Monkeypox is a rare viral infection. The virus is found naturally in some animals in Central and West Africa.
There has recently been an increase in cases in many countries, for this reason I decided to analyze the data taken from the website https://ourworldindata.org/monkeypox, and find out how this disease is spreading. 

Data were collected from 01.31.22 to 07.15.22.

I started by understanding the data. Some of them are: Date, Suspected cases, Confirmed cases, Gender, Symptoms and Location.

I uploaded the table in SQLSERVER and cleaned the data using SQL command. After the data was processed, I connected Tableau in SQLSERVER and created the data visualization. 

So I found that Monkeypox in 6 months arrived in several countries and in all continents. So far, Spain is the most affected country, and most of the infected population are men. Despite the disease spreading around the world, Senior Writers say that Monkeypox won't be the next global pandemic, because at least two vaccines and two antivirals have been approved against monkeypox or its close relative smallpox.
