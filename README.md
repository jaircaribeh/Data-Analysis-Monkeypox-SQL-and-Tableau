# Data-Analysis-Monkeypox-SQL-and-Tableau
A data analysis using SQL and Tableau to show the spread of the disease  in the world


Monkeypox is a rare viral infection. The virus is found naturally in some animals in Central and West Africa.
There has recently been an increase in cases in many countries, for this reason I decided to analyze the data taken from the website https://ourworldindata.org/monkeypox, and find out how this disease is spreading.
